## Requirements

- Git
- Docker (optional)

## Extension Settings
- `pintos.buildUtils` by default true. Runs `cd utils && make` before execute "pintos health" command
- `pintos.addUtilsToPath` by default true. Adds the local `utils/` to PATH (only in this process, it doesn't change your config files)
- `pintos.phases` the folders of the phases (probably you don't need to change it)

### They're used as default for configuration (confirmation is always requested)
- `pintos.baseRepository` the repo URL to get a snapshot of pintos code
- `pintos.baseRepositoryCodeFolder` the folder containing the source code of PintOS, if your Git supports sparse checkout only clon the folder (with the original project the size will be reduced from 30MB to ~7MB)
